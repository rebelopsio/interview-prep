# Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

**Difficulty**: Easy
**Pattern**: two-pointers
**LeetCode**: 28
**Educative**: [Course/Problem Reference]

## Problem Statement
[Leetcode - #28](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string)

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.



Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.


Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
