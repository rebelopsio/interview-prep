# Fast and Slow Pointers

## When to Use
- Fast and slow pointers method is typically used to analyze the data structure or properties of the data, as opposed to two pointers which is used to compare data values.
- You have a linear data structure like a [[linked-list]] or [[array]]
- Additionally:
    - Use if the problem you are solving involves detecting a loop within a [[linked-list]] or [[array]] or involves finding an intersection between two [[linked-list]] or [[array]]. Or
    - You need to identify the element where the second part of a divided data set begins. Ex - finding the middle element of an [[array]] or [[linked-list]], which marks the start of the second half.

## Key Insights
- Pointer start at the same location and then start moving at different speeds
- In a typical implementation, the fast pointer will iterate at 2x or two times the iterations as the slow pointer.
