# Coding Interview Preparation Plan

A structured 12-week preparation plan integrating multiple resources with focus on pattern recognition and confidence building.

## Resources Stack

- **ðŸ“š Books**: Alex Xu's "Coding Interview Patterns" + "Data Structures the Fun Way"
- **ðŸ’» Interactive Learning**: Educative (Grokking courses + AI Code Mentor)
- **ðŸŽ¯ Problem Practice**: neetcode.io
- **ðŸŽ¤ Mock Interviews**: Educative AI + human practice

## 12-Week Schedule Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-4)
**Focus**: Pattern internalization with low pressure
- **Primary Resource**: Educative (40% of time)
- **Daily Structure**: 90min Educative patterns â†’ 60min neetcode.io â†’ 60min book reading
- **Goal**: Master core patterns in interactive environment

### Phase 2: Pattern Application (Weeks 5-8)
**Focus**: Volume practice with pattern reinforcement
- **Primary Resource**: neetcode.io (40% of time)
- **Daily Structure**: 2hr problem solving â†’ 90min Educative advanced â†’ book review
- **Goal**: Build speed and pattern recognition

### Phase 3: Interview Simulation (Weeks 9-12)
**Focus**: Pressure inoculation and performance optimization
- **Primary Resource**: Mock interviews (25% of time)
- **Daily Structure**: Timed practice â†’ targeted weakness work â†’ mock interviews
- **Goal**: Confident performance under pressure

## Daily Time Allocation (6 hours)

- **40%** Active problem-solving (2.4 hours)
- **30%** Pattern learning via Educative (1.8 hours)
- **20%** Book study (1.2 hours)
- **10%** Review/mock interviews (0.6 hours)

## Weekly Schedule Template

| Day | Focus | Morning (2.5h) | Afternoon (2h) | Evening (1.5h) |
|-----|-------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Mon/Thu** | Pattern Learning | New Educative patterns | Xu's book chapters | neetcode.io variations |
| **Tue/Fri** | Problem Practice | neetcode.io mixed | Educative with AI hints | Solution review |
| **Wed** | System Design | Xu's system design | Educative system design | Design practice |
| **Sat** | Mock Interviews | Mock interview | Performance analysis | Weakness targeting |
| **Sun** | Review & Rest | Spaced repetition | Planning | Rest (2h) |

## Key Educative Courses

1. **Grokking the Coding Interview Patterns** (85 hours, 28+ patterns, 500+ problems)
2. **Grokking Dynamic Programming** (Advanced DP patterns with visualization)
3. **Grokking the System Design Interview** (RESHADED framework practice)

## Confidence Building Strategy

### Graduated Exposure (Weeks 1-12)
- **Weeks 1-3**: Private practice on Educative only
- **Week 4**: Add verbal explanation while coding
- **Week 5**: Record yourself solving problems
- **Weeks 6-8**: Educative AI mock interviews + peer practice
- **Weeks 9-12**: Human mock interviews alternating with AI practice

### AI Code Mentor Usage
- Start with liberal AI assistance
- Gradually reduce reliance as confidence builds
- Use for judgment-free guidance during difficult problems
- Practice visualization recall from memory

## Progress Tracking

### Daily Metrics
- [ ] Problems solved (with difficulty rating)
- [ ] Patterns practiced
- [ ] Time per activity
- [ ] Confidence level (1-5 scale)
- [ ] AI hints used

### Weekly Goals
- [ ] 80% pattern recognition accuracy before advancing
- [ ] Complete assigned problems/chapters
- [ ] One mock interview minimum
- [ ] Identify and target 2-3 weak patterns

### Assessment Schedule
- **Tuesdays & Fridays**: Take Educative assessments (track improvement)
- **Weekly**: Review progress spreadsheet
- **Bi-weekly**: Adjust focus based on weak areas

## Resource Usage Strategy

### When to Use Each Resource
- **Educative**: Initial pattern learning, interactive practice, confidence building
- **neetcode.io**: Volume practice, video explanations when stuck
- **Books**: Deep conceptual understanding, reference material
- **Mock Interviews**: Pressure simulation, performance feedback

### Avoiding Overwhelm
- **Primary Resource Rule**: One resource gets 40% of weekly time
- **Time-boxing**: Never more than 2 resources per 90-minute block
- **No Resource Switching**: When stuck, use hints/AI instead of jumping platforms

## Success Metrics

### Technical Readiness
- [ ] Recognize patterns in 80% of medium problems within 2 minutes
- [ ] Implement solutions for known patterns within time limits
- [ ] Explain approach clearly while coding

### Confidence Indicators
- [ ] Comfortable with AI-assisted practice
- [ ] Can verbalize thought process under observation
- [ ] Performance improves rather than degrades in mock interviews
- [ ] Anxiety manageable during timed practice

## Emergency Protocols

### When Stuck on Problems
1. Use Educative AI Code Mentor for hints
2. Review pattern in Alex Xu's book
3. Watch neetcode.io explanation
4. Practice similar problems until pattern clicks

### When Feeling Overwhelmed
1. Reduce to single resource for the day
2. Focus on previously mastered patterns
3. Use Educative's private environment only
4. Take planned rest day if needed
